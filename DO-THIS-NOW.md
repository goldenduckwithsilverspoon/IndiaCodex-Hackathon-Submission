4. Push to GitHub

**OR manually:**
```powershell
cd C:\Users\dhwin\Project-Revolutionary
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/goldenduckwithsilverspoon/IndiaCodex-Hackathon-Submission.git
git add .
git commit -m "IndiaCodex Hackathon Submission - CardanoStream"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://github.com/goldenduckwithsilverspoon/IndiaCodex-Hackathon-Submission
2. Check that all files are there
3. Verify README.md displays correctly
4. Confirm license is MIT

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway (10 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub

   ```
8. **Click:** "Deploy"
9. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment
10. **Copy your live URL:** `https://your-app.up.railway.app`

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment (3 minutes)

2. Find this line:
   ```markdown
   **🌐 Deployed Application:** [Coming Soon - Railway/Render Deployment]
   ```
3. Replace with:
   ```markdown
   **🌐 Deployed Application:** https://your-app.up.railway.app
   ```
4. Save file
5. Push update:
   ```powershell

   git commit -m "Add live deployment URL"
   git push
   ```

### Step 6: Record Video Demo (10 minutes)

**Use OBS Studio or Windows Game Bar:**

1. **Start recording**
2. **Follow this script (2-3 minutes):**

```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], presenting CardanoStream for IndiaCodex Hackathon.

[Show README on GitHub]
CardanoStream is a decentralized CDN combining Cardano blockchain 
with Masumi Network's P2P infrastructure.

[Show architecture diagram]
Publishers upload content, it's distributed via Masumi Network,
and smart contracts on Cardano handle payments and SLAs.

[Show browser/Postman]
Let me demo the live API. Here's the stats endpoint...
[Test the API]

Now I upload a file and get a CID back...
[Demo upload]

And retrieve it using that CID...
[Demo retrieval]

[Show smart contracts code briefly]
Behind the scenes, we have three Aiken smart contracts for
storage payments, bandwidth channels, and node registry.

This is the first project bridging Masumi and Cardano,
creating value for both ecosystems. Thank you!"
```
